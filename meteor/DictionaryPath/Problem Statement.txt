Assume you have a dictionary containing all the valid words in the English language.  Write a method that takes two strings as input, and returns an array of words 
as output.  The first element in the array must be the first input string, the last must be the second input string.  Each element starting with the second must be
a valid English word, produced by transforming the previous word using one of two operations.  The two operations are swap() and replace().  The swap() operation 
swaps the position of two letters in the word, and the replace() operation replaces any single letter in the word with any other letter.  An example:

method("trap", "salt") => ["trap", "prat", "plat", "slat", "salt"]

In this case the method performed the following operations:

  swap("trap", 0, 3)      => "prat"
  replace("prat", 1, 'l') => "plat"
  replace("plat", 0, 's') => "slat"
  swap("slat", 1, 2)      => "salt"

The task here is to generalize the method to work with arbitrary words as input.  You should not assume words will always be the same length, but obviously if they 
are not then the input should be considered invalid.  You should also not assume there will always be a way to "connect" the two input words.
