There are four problems provided in this solution.  Only two of these are required:

Required: MessageQueue
Required: ConnectFour

These two problems represent the kinds of bugs and tasks that you'll be expected to solve and perform routinely.
Together, they shouldn't take you more than a few hours to complete.

The remaining two problems are optional.  Think of them as bonus points or extra credit to be done only if you
have extra time and enjoy solving these kinds of problems.  Leaving them unsolved will not count against you.

Optional: EnglishNumbers
Optional: DictionaryPath

---

To solve the MessageQueue problem, you should only need to modify MessageQueue.cpp.  Do not modify the interfaces or test harness.
To solve the ConnectFour problem, you will need to create one or more files of your own.  You are free to modify that project however you wish.
If you choose to solve the EnglishNumbers problem, you should only need to modify EnglishNumbers.cpp.
If you choose to solve the DictionaryPath problem, you should only need to modify DictionaryPath.cpp.
